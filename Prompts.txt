Prompt: I have a database of bears. Each bear has a size field(number) and colors field(array of strings). 
I want to implement a feature where a user can type 'Show me big bears with brown or white fur' and the backend converts it to:
{
  size: number, // eg: anything above 150 is 'big'
  colors: ['brown', 'white']
}

Please generate a feature that:
1. Takes a natural language string as input
2. Returns an object with size and colors keys
3. Maps 'small', 'medium', 'big' to numerical ranges (eg: small < 100, medium 100-200, big > 200)
4. Handles missing size or colors
5. Returns the output in typeScript
